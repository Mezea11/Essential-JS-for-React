This file contains a sample data set of books in object format, where the goal is to practice my JavaScript fundamentals. In this simple app I've used the Quokka plugin to be able to observe the data live inside VSCode directly.
I've practiced immutable/mutable arrays, spread and rest operators, data destructuring, ternary/arrow functions and more.
